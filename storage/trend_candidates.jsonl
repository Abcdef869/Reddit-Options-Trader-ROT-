I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. \n\nIn the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per)  During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?”  Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended  up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. \n\nIt has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel\n\nto hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA.

Here are the Best Takes and stocks", "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants?\n\n1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over  the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. \n\n2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. \n\n3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless.\n\n4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. \n\n5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR…\n\nPersonally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall.\n\nOil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years.\n\nDid i miss anything?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "score": 1019, "num_comments": 622, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "author": "ahlornjtvn139", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q3cmyi/what_does_trump_really_want_with_venezuela_here/", "flair": "Industry Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}}, "ts": 1767573668}

There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping.\n\nOne refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term.\n\nAnother one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.

Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking. It will take billions and years of work by companies like **Schlumberger** and **Halliburton** to get production back to 2 million barrels per day.  \n\nNow to the reffineries: \n\nThe real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread, which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel. When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling.\n\nLogistics: \n\nThe shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles. (any suggestions?)\n\nFinally, you have to consider the impact on the US shale industry.

The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers.\n\nEven before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla.\n\nAfter spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce.\n\nMusk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union.\n\nPartly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October.\n\nHowever, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September.\n\nShareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass.\n\nCritics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity.\n\nWhile Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025.\n\nTesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there.\n\nSome analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters.\n\nIn a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.”\n\nBesides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely.\n\nBut Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/02/tesla-tsla-q4-2025-vehicle-deliveries.html)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "score": 1724, "num_comments": 319, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "author": "Puginator", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q1ziog/tesla_reports_418227_deliveries_for_the_fourth/", "flair": null, "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}}, "ts": 1767573668}

Why Musk’s venture could be biggest IPO ever", "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record.\n\n Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion.\n\n SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019.\n\nWall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood.\n\nSpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year.\n\nAnalyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink.\n\nLin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. \n\n“In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. \n\nTo be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. \n\nA bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "score": 42, "num_comments": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "author": "Guy_PCS", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1q2azqr/pro_analysis_spacex_stock_debut_is_the_big_market/", "flair": "Company Discussion", "is_crosspost": false}, "top_comments": []}}, "ts": 1767573668}
